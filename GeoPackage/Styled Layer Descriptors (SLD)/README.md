# OS MasterMap Water Network - SLD
These are the SLD files for OS MasterMap Water Network. They were created using GeoServer.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## How to use
Download the SLD files, as well as the folder of SVG symbols (os-mastermap-water-network-symbols).

## Setup
You will need to copy the folder of SVGs (os-mastermap-water-network-symbols) into the right location before applying the styles. In Geoserver on Windows this is typically C:\Program Files (x86)\Geoserver 2.x.x\data_dir\styles.

Create a Layer Group with the Water Nodes layer above the Water Network layer.
